#Variable names cannot be Python keywords
#Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meaning.
#For example, you cannot use if, else, while, for, break, class, def, return, import, from, as, pass, None, True, False, and, or, not, is, in, global, nonlocal, assert, lambda, try, except, finally, raise, with, yield as variable names.

#Conventions for variable names:
#1. Use meaningful names that describe the purpose of the variable.
#2. Use lowercase letters and separate words with underscores (snake_case).
#3. Avoid using single-character names except for counters or iterators.
#4. Be consistent with your naming conventions throughout your code.
#5. Avoid using names that are too long or too short.
#6. Avoid using special characters or spaces in variable names.
#7. Use plural names for variables that hold collections of items (e.g., names, scores).
#8. Avoid using names that are similar to built-in functions or types (e.g.,
#   list, str, int, float, dict, set, tuple).
#9. Use comments to explain the purpose of the variable if it's not immediately clear.
#10. Avoid using reserved words or keywords as variable names.
