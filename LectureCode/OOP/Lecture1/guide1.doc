Lecture 1.

Lecture Objectives:

By the end of this lecture, learners will be able to:

1. Understand the concept of a class as a blueprint for creating objects.

2. Create Python classes with attributes and methods.

3. Instantiate objects (create instances) from classes.

4. Access and modify attributes of objects.

5. Define and call methods to perform actions with objects.

6. Apply OOP basics to model simple real-world entities in Python.

Recap:

OOP is a way of organizing your code using classes (blueprints) and objects (instances of those blueprints).
It helps you model real-world things and their behavior.

Key concepts:

Class → The blueprint of an object

Object / Instance → A specific example of a class

Attributes → Data stored inside an object (like variables)

Methods → Functions that belong to an object (behavior)

Inheritance → Reusing code from another class.

Enough of talk. Let's get to the lab section!
